                    <p class="fst-italic">Dentures
                      When natural teeth are lost, complete dentures serve as a reliable way to restore both function and appearance. Traditional dentures often present challenges such as poor stability and reduced chewing efficiency. Nowadays, dental implants are frequently used to improve the stability and retention of dentures.
                      A complete denture is a prosthetic device designed to replace natural teeth, providing essential support for the cheeks and lips.

                      <strong>Conventional vs. Immediate Dentures</strong><br>
                      Dentures are typically made of acrylic and can be created in two different forms:<br>
                      <strong>Conventional Dentures:</strong> Fabricated after all teeth have been removed and the gum tissues have healed completely.<br>
                      <strong>Immediate Dentures:</strong> Created and placed immediately after tooth extraction, allowing the gums to heal underneath the denture.
                      Upper dentures, usually made of flesh-colored acrylic, cover the palate, while lower dentures are horseshoe-shaped to provide space for the tongue. Denture teeth can be constructed from plastic, porcelain, or a combination of both materials. Additionally, dentures can be made to fit over treated teeth, and complete dentures can be secured to dental implants for enhanced stability.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      As time passes, dentures will naturally wear out and will require replacement, repair, or relining to maintain proper jaw alignment. This is necessary because the bone and gum ridges change shape after tooth extraction. Regular dental check-ups are crucial to monitor the condition of your oral tissues for any signs of disease or other changes.

                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Proper care of your dentures is crucial to ensure their longevity and your oral health. Here are seven essential tips for maintaining your dentures:
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>Daily Brushing:</strong> Brush your dentures inside and out daily using a soft, large nylon denture toothbrush with round-ended bristles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Denture Creams:</strong> Avoid toothpaste, as it is too abrasive and can scratch your dentures. Always rinse them with cold water immediately after brushing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proper Storage:</strong> Keep dentures out of hot water to avoid warping. Instead, store them in cold water and denture cleaning solution to prevent them from drying out. </li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Inspection:</strong> Inspect your dentures weekly for signs of wear or damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medication Awareness:</strong> Inform your dentist and doctor about any medications you are taking, as they may impact your denture health.</li>
                        <li><strong>Address Loose Dentures:</strong> Have loose dentures checked immediately to prevent friction and pressure on gum tissues and bones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Routine Examinations:</strong> Schedule semi-annual examinations with your prosthodontist. Most dental insurance policies cover new dentures every five years.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Oral Exams and Denture Maintenance</strong><br>

                    <h3>Immediate Dentures</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      When the complete extraction of your remaining teeth is necessary, immediate dentures offer a solution to avoid the discomfort and embarrassment of being without teeth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      The process begins before your teeth are extracted. Impressions of your existing teeth and gums are taken to create precise duplicates for placement post-extraction. On the day of your extraction, your immediate dentures are ready to be inserted, providing you with a natural-looking smile right away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>What to Know About Immediate Dentures</strong><br>
                      Since the dentures cannot be precisely fitted before extraction, some aesthetic compromises might be necessary to account for space or structural issues. Temporary liners, tissue conditioners, and relines may be required, which could incur additional costs. Your specialist will guide you through the process, ensuring the best care while considering your budget and dental coverage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Post-Extraction Care and Maintenance</strong>
                      Following the extraction and application of immediate dentures, it is crucial to adhere to all postoperative instructions. As your gums and bone recede during healing, regular check-ups are essential to monitor progress and minimize complications. Temporary linings or tissue conditioners will be needed to maintain an optimal fit, requiring adjustments throughout the healing period. Once healing is complete, a permanent reline will be necessary to ensure a comfortable and precise fit.

                    <h3>Partial Dentures</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      When you need to replace one or more missing teeth, removable partial dentures offer an effective solution. They restore your natural appearance, improve your ability to speak clearly, and enhance chewing function, all while boosting your confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Materials Used in Partial Dentures</strong>
                      Partial dentures can be made from a metal and acrylic composite or entirely from acrylic. The specific needs and anatomy of each patient guide the design of the partial denture, aiming to create a self-cleansing appliance that preserves remaining teeth and oral tissues.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Our clinic ensures that your partial denture is designed to evenly distribute chewing forces across the entire surface, including the remaining teeth and soft tissues. To achieve this balance, adjustments to your existing teeth may be recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Generally, metal partials are preferred for their structural superiority, being thinner and more hygienic than acrylic versions. Acrylic partials are typically used as transitional or temporary solutions and are not intended for long-term use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Benefits of Partial Dentures</strong><br>
                      Partial dentures help prevent existing natural teeth from shifting, which can cause aesthetic issues and jawbone problems. They also improve your ability to grind and chew food, leading to better digestion and overall health.

                    <h3>Denture Reline</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Over time, changes in your gum tissues can cause dentures to become loose and uncomfortable. To maintain a secure and functional fit, dentures typically require professional relining every one to two years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Understanding Denture Reline</strong><br>
                      When your dentures no longer fit snugly due to changes in your gums, a denture reline can restore their fit and comfort. There are several types of denture reline procedures available:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Hard Reline</strong><br>
                      Recommended every two years for full dentures, a hard reline involves:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Removing a layer of plastic from the interior surface of the denture.</li>
                        <li>Filling the denture with a putty-like material that conforms to your mouth's contours.</li>
                        <li>Adjusting the denture in the lab to ensure maximum contact with your gums, enhancing stability and comfort.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Soft Reline</strong><br>
                      For patients with sensitive gums or sore spots, a soft reline uses a pliable material that stays flexible for one to two years. This reduces the likelihood of discomfort and soreness compared to standard acrylic hard relines.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Temporary Reline</strong><br>
                      In cases where gums are inflamed or misshapen due to prolonged denture use without servicing, a temporary reline may be recommended:
                      <ul>
                        <li>A medicated reline material is applied temporarily to reduce inflammation and improve denture fit.</li>
                        <li>This temporary solution provides comfort and stability until the gums return to a healthier state, preparing for a new denture or hard reline.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Implant overdentures are prostheses that are securely retained and supported by dental implants. Unlike standard dentures, which rest on the jaw and often cause discomfort and instability, implant overdentures offer a stable and convenient solution. Traditional dentures can make chewing difficult, limiting your diet and enjoyment of food.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Modern dentistry provides a solution with implant-supported overdentures. This treatment replaces missing teeth with a full dental bridge anchored by implants. This method requires fewer implants, reducing both treatment time and overall cost, while significantly improving comfort and functionality.

                    <h3>Dental Bridges</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Missing one or more teeth can significantly impact your appearance, chewing function, and overall dental health. Teeth work together for many daily functions, from eating to speaking. When teeth are missing, these activities become challenging. Moreover, replacing missing teeth is essential to maintain the integrity of your gums and jawbone. Fixed dental bridges are a simple yet effective way to restore both dental health and appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>What Is a Dental Bridge?</strong><br>
                      A dental bridge replaces missing teeth by anchoring a false tooth (or teeth) to crowns placed on adjacent teeth. The crowns and the false tooth are joined and then cemented to the prepared teeth. This structure is not removable by the patient and requires special aids for cleaning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Why Do I Need a Dental Bridge? </strong><br>
                      A dental bridge is crucial for both oral functionality and appearance. It helps support your lips and cheeks, maintaining a strong jawline. Missing back teeth can cause your mouth to sink and your face to appear older. Additionally, missing teeth can lead to speech disorders, as they are essential for clear pronunciation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Beyond aesthetics, dental health is the primary reason for needing a bridge. Teeth are designed to complement each other, and missing teeth can place unusual stress on gums and other oral tissues, leading to various disorders. One significant risk of missing teeth is an increased likelihood of gum disease, which can be mitigated by a dental bridge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Materials Used for a Dental Bridge</strong><br>
                      Dental bridges are typically made from gold alloys, non-precious alloys, high-strength ceramics, or a combination of these materials.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Caring for a Dental Bridge</strong>
                      Oral hygiene is critical when you have a dental bridge. Since a bridge relies on neighboring teeth for support, plaque accumulation under the bridge must be addressed with special floss (super floss) used daily to clean the area effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      By addressing the gaps left by missing teeth with a dental bridge, you can restore your oral health, improve your appearance, and enhance your overall quality of life.

                      <strong>How Long Does it Take to Get a Dental Crown? </strong><br>
                      The process of getting a dental crown typically requires two visits:
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>First Visit:</strong> The dentist removes decay, reshapes the tooth, and covers it with a temporary plastic crown.</li>
                        <li><strong>Second Visit:</strong> The final crown is evaluated for aesthetics, function, and fit. Once everything is satisfactory, the crown is cemented into place.</li>
                      </ol>

                    <h3>Bruxism Treatment</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      Bruxism, or teeth grinding, often occurs unconsciously during sleep and can have damaging effects on both teeth and the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ). Fortunately, effective treatment options can alleviate these issues and protect your dental health.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Understanding Bruxism</strong><br>
                      Bruxism is a sleep disorder characterized by the grinding of teeth and clenching of the jaw. This activity can occur during sleep or even during waking hours when a person is idle for extended periods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Symptoms of Bruxism</strong><br>
                      Common symptoms of bruxism include:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Earaches</li>
                        <li>Headaches</li>
                        <li>Depression</li>
                        <li>Anxiety</li>
                        <li>Tooth wear and poor dental health</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <strong>Treatment Options</strong><br>
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>Custom Night Guard:</strong>
                          A custom-made night guard is tailored to fit your teeth precisely. Made from acrylic, it minimizes abrasive grinding during sleep, thereby protecting your teeth and alleviating pressure on the TMJ. This long-term solution is highly effective in preventing tooth damage caused by bruxism.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stock Night Guard:</strong>
                          Available over-the-counter in standard sizes, a stock night guard is made from materials like polyurethane. While inexpensive, it provides minimal protection and may be less comfortable due to poor retention. Custom night guards are recommended for optimal comfort and effectiveness.</li>
